          </div>
        <br><br>
            <p class="lead mb-5">General practice is one of the cornerstones of the National Health Service but is currently under pressure as a result of a shortage of the workforce and an increasing number of people with long-term conditions who need regular care from General Practice and primary care. These pressures mean that it is essential to maximise the efficient organisation of staff teams in General Practice. <br><br> There is very little evidence to inform GPs and service commissioners what size or structure of practice, or what mix of professional staff, works best for team members and patients. Therefore, this research aims to provide evidence as to how the composition of GP teams and team climate affect the quality of care and health outcomes for patients, and the costs for practice.</p>
            <p class="lead mb-5">Research Aim: To explore how organisation, skill mix and climate in GP teams relate to quality of care, clinical
effectiveness and human resource costs.</p>
            <p>In this mixed methods research study, we are carrying out the following:
            <ul class="fa-ul mb-0"> 
                <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-info-circle text-info"></i>A literature review to compile lessons about skills mix in similar contexts.</li>
                    <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-info-circle text-info"></i>Analysis of currently available data sets to assess how organisation and skill mix in practices in England are related to the quality and effectiveness of care, based on hospitalisation for conditions which should be managed within General Practice.</li> 
<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-info-circle text-info"></i>Survey staff in a sample of practices nationwide to explore how workforce issues affect staff wellbeing and job satisfaction.</li> 
<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-info-circle text-info"></i>Observe and interview staff in 12 selected practices to investigate how team climate affects patient experiences.</li> 
<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-info-circle text-info"></i>Create guidelines for all practices on the best mix of professional staff and promoting productive team climate through consensus.</li> 
                <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-info-circle text-info"></i>Use innovative means to disseminate the findings throughout the GP community, and to NHS managers, government organisations, academics and the public.</li>
